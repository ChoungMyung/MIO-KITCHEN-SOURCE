class ConfigParser:
    """
    A simple INI-style configuration file parser.

    This parser handles sections ([section_name]), key-value pairs (key = value),
    and comments (lines starting with '#' or ';', or inline after a value using '#' or ';').
    All keys and values are stored and returned as strings.

    A default section (internally named '__init__', accessible via `ConfigParser._DEFAULT_SECTION_NAME`)
    is used for key-value pairs that appear before any explicit section header in a parsed file or string.
    This default section is written to an output file with its name (e.g., `[__init__]`)
    if it contains any entries.

    Parsing Behavior:
    - Section names and keys are case-sensitive.
    - Leading/trailing whitespace is stripped from section names, keys, and values.
    - Lines that are blank, consist only of whitespace, or start with '#' or ';' are ignored.
    - Inline comments (e.g., `key = value # comment`) are stripped from values.
    - If a key is empty after stripping whitespace (e.g., from " = value"), the line is ignored.
    - Section re-declarations during parsing will result in the section being reset (cleared of previous keys).
